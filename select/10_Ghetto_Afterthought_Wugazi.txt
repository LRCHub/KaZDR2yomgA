ODB -I donno how ya'll said, but when it comes to the children,
Wu-tang is for the children, we teach the children
You know what i mean, puffy is good, but Wu-tang is the best!

Monster cut truck balley s***
Champagne is spillin while we hit every club that my Denali hit
Out for this four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my flintstones look crazy in my sweater
Pa it's not a big fairy tale that's my ammo
F*** b****** on the reg with no problemo
Iceberg, rabbits, and the fox and more
Where I coped two more, bought four for Rza
Badboy thank you for this special deliver
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder woman armed, Ghost is intelligent
May 30 over dust dime I was killin 'em
Did cash on one sixteen I was feelin 'em
Then Dave kept the criss cold dollar bill on 'em
I lived it out -- special delivery!
I spit it out -- special delivery!
I lived it out -- special delivery!
I spit it out -- special delivery!

I want that want that want that want that
I need that need that need that need that
I want want that want that want that
Come give come give come give it to me

My eyes are sore, bein a senator
Behind closed doors hiding truth to the sequal
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets.

Feel the heat from the streets, I got to eat
Talk what I walk, I stalk with bronze feet
Ancient spells, yell durag sheet
She rags sheet, jump on the jame with with 36 peak
Beat up the beat, overload rap treat mix
Cape in the wind like the John Wu flix
Now, take the spirit, crash more clearer
The spreadin of body, covers the man in the mirror(echo)

Ziggie za za za za, Ziggie ze ze za ze x12 (in background)

I want that want that want that want that
I need that need that need that need that
I want want that want that want that
Come give come give come give it to me

I'mma reveal EVERYTHING x 21

OK, i want you all to know that is ODB and i love you all! Peace.
