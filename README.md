# Tame Impala – Afterthought

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I might be crazy
Senses betray me
Are you parading all your lovers
to bait me?
You only call me
To drive you to safety
But you never stay,
must be so easy to play me
I can be emotional
If you need me to
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
Ninety-nine days,
you'd think I'd know how
I can be emotional
If you need me to
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
I beg you, don't make me
say it out loud
No matter what I do
I'm an afterthought to you
I'm not complaining
But I've noticed lately
When we're alone, it's like
I'm keeping you waiting
My hopes are fading
'Cause nothing is changing
I'm still so far away
from calling you baby
Over at Josephine's
She's inbetween the sheets
No time for pleasantries
No time for pleasant dreams
Not an angel, not by any means
But got something, everyone agrees
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
Ninety-nine days,
you'd think I'd know how
I can get emotional
Like your lovers do
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
I beg you, don't make me
say it out loud
No matter what I do
I'm an afterthought to you
I'm an afterthought to you
I'm an afterthought to you
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
Ninety-nine days,
you'd think it by now
I can be emotional
If you need me to
Tell me, what do I say
to turn this around?
I beg you, don't make me
say it out loud
No matter what I do
I'm an afterthought to you
I said, no matter what I do
I'm an afterthought to you
Just an afterthought to you
I'm an afterthought to you
